Optional:

- `dst` (String) Destination path.
- `src` (String) Source file.



<a id="nestedatt--disk_setup"></a>
### Nested Schema for `disk_setup`

Optional:

- `layout` (String) Partitions can be specified by providing a list to layout, where each entry in the list is either a size or a list containing a size and the numerical value for a partition type. The size for partitions is specified in percentage of disk space, not in bytes (e.g. a size of 33 would take up 1/3 of the disk space). The partition type defaults to '83' (Linux partition), for other types of partition, such as Linux swap, the type must be passed as part of a list along with the size. **Boolean not supported**
- `overwrite` (Boolean) Controls whether this module tries to be safe about writing partition tables or not. If overwrite: false is set, the device will be checked for a partition table and for a file system and if either is found, the operation will be skipped. If overwrite: true is set, no checks will be performed. Using overwrite: true is dangerous and can lead to data loss, so double check that the correct device has been specified if using this option. *Default: false.*
- `table_type` (String) The partition table type, either mbr or gpt. *Default: mbr.*


<a id="nestedblock--fs_setup"></a>
### Nested Schema for `fs_setup`

Optional:

- `extra_opts` (String) Optional options to pass to the filesystem creation command. Ignored if you using cmd directly.
- `filesystem` (String) Filesystem type to create. E.g., ext4 or btrfs.
- `label` (String) Label for the filesystem.
- `overwrite` (Boolean) If true, overwrite any existing filesystem. Using overwrite: true for filesystems is dangerous and can lead to data loss, so double check the entry in fs_setup. Default: false.
- `partition` (String) *(string/auto/any/none)* The partition option can be set to auto, in which this module will search for the existence of a filesystem matching the label, type and device of the fs_setup entry and will skip creating the filesystem if one is found. The partition option may also be set to any, in which case any file system that matches type and device will cause this module to skip filesystem creation for the fs_setup entry, regardless of label matching or not. To write a filesystem directly to a device, use partition: none. partition: none will always write the filesystem, even when the label and filesystem are matched, and overwrite is false. *Integer not supported*
- `replace_fs` (String) Ignored unless partition is auto or any.


<a id="nestedblock--growpart"></a>
### Nested Schema for `growpart`

 > *Note:*
While hashed_password is better than plain_text_passwd, using passwd in user-data represents a security risk as user-data could be accessible by third-parties depending on your cloud platform.
- `homedir` (String) Home dir for user. `Default: /home/<username>.`
- `inactive` (String) String representing the number of days until the user is disabled.
- `lock_passwd` (Boolean) <span style="color:red">Disable password login. **Default: true.**</span>
- `name` (String) The user's login name. Required otherwise user creation will be skipped for this user.
- `no_create_home` (Boolean) Do not create home directory. **Default: false.**

- `no_user_group` (Boolean) Do not create group named after user. **Default: false.**
- `passwd` (String, Sensitive) Hash of user password applied when user does not exist. This will NOT be applied if the user already exists. To generate this hash, run: `mkpasswd -method=SHA-512 -rounds=4096`.
 > *Note:*
While hashed password is better than plain text, using passwd in user-data represents a security risk as user-data could be accessible by third-parties depending on your cloud platform.
- `plain_text_passwd` (String, Sensitive) Clear text of user password to be applied. This will be applied even if the user is pre-existing. There are many more secure options than using plain text passwords, such as ssh_import_id or hashed_passwd. Do not use this in production as user-data and your password can be exposed.
    >*<span style="color:red">Security Notice:</span>*
    The password will be stored *unencrypted* in your Terraform state file.
    **Use of this attribute for production deployments is *not* recommended!**

- `selinux_user` (String) SELinux user for user's login. Default to default SELinux user.
- `shell` (String) Path to the user's login shell. The default is to set no shell, which results in a system-specific default being used.

Any SSH login as this username will timeout and prompt with a message to login instead as the `default_username` for this instance. **Default: **false. This key can not be combined with `ssh_import_id` or `ssh_authorized_keys`.
- `sudo` (String) Sudo rule to use or false. Absence of a sudo value or `null` will result in no sudo rules added for this user.
